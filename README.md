### Data Mining - Assignment 2
This repository contains the code and results for Data Mining - Assignment 2, where various data mining techniques were applied to two datasets: Mall_Customers and Iris Dataset.

## Datasets
- Mall_Customers Dataset:
Sourced from Kaggle.
Contains customer demographics and behavior data.
- Iris Dataset:
A classic dataset containing measurements of Iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).
## Techniques Applied
- Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature scaling, label encoding.
- Unsupervised Learning: K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering with clustering validation (Silhouette Score).
- Feature Selection: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- Supervised Learning Classifiers: Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.
- Manual Feature Extraction: Using mean and standard deviation features for the Iris dataset.
- Automated Feature Extraction: PCA and Information Gain using Weka.
## Key Results
- Supervised Learning Classifiers:
- SVM and KNN achieved 100% accuracy.
- Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost performed well with 93%-95% accuracy.
- Feature Extraction: Improved classification performance, particularly with manual feature extraction in the Iris dataset.
## How to Run
Clone this repository.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, weka).
Run the Python scripts for preprocessing, training models, and evaluation.
